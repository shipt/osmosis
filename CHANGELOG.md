## v2.1.0
* Updated several dependencies
* Updated package.json to reflect React 18 compatibility as peer dependency
* Other maintenance changes
* Updated the wrapper component name to be set from the store hook name

## v2.0.2
* Updated for better intellisence using templates
* Added `useStore` to be attached to objects returned from `setupStore`, which wraps and abstracts the need to explicitly call `useContext(StoreContext)` when subscribing to a store. This also helps with mocking store objects when unit testing components subscribed to a store.

## v2.0.1
* Minor dependency updates

## v2.0.0
* BREAKING CHANGE - When subscribing to a store via the `useContext` hook, the returning store object is now a single object which represents the store. Previously this was an array, but the array was arbitrary.
* chore/bug - Reworked store providers to correctly target rerenders only to subscribing children components. Previously there was a nuance where updates could occur even without a context subscription.

## v1.3.0
* feature - support multiple dynamic stores and forwarding props into the store custom hooks
* chore - fix persisted falsy value causing default value to come back

## v1.2.1

* Updates peer dependency
* Fix dependabot alerts

## v1.2.0

* BREAKING CHANGE - Modified the return format for `setupStore` to be a single object instead of an array of parts
